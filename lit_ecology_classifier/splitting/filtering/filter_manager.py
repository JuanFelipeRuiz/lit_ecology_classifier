"""
Manages the diffrent types of filter strategy for the splitting of the image overview.
ÃŽt can handle the following input types for the filter strategy:

- a string with the class name of the filter strategy to be used
    currently only packages in the `lit_ecology_classifier.splitting.filtering` are supported
- a initialized instance of the BaseFilter class
- a subclass of the BaseFilter class that need to be initialized with the filter_args
- if no filter strategy is provided, a error is raised.

The main function of the class is the `apply_filter` method that applies the filter strategy
on the given image overview.
