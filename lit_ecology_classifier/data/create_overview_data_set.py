class CreateOverviewDf:
    """Generate an overview DataFrame based on the different ZooLake dataset versions, including images and metadata.

    Image Processing and Metadata Extraction:
        Each image in the dataset is processed individually to extract metadata from its file name and folder path.
        The SHA256 hashing algorithm is used to calculate a unique hash value for each image, which enables identical
        duplicate detection by identifying images with the same hash value. The hash value also facilitates merging
        images from different dataset versions into a single DataFrame, with a one-hot encoded column indicating in
        which data set versions the image occurs.

    Additional columns can be generated to indicate in which split (train, test, or validation) the image appears,
    based on a pickle files. For version 1, the split information is stored in separate .txt files and is also
    implemented in this class. The process assumes that the images are stored externally with the original
    structure of the corresponding ZooLake dataset version.

    Attributes:
        zoolake_version_paths (dict): Maps dataset versions to their corresponding file paths.

        split_file_paths  (dict): Maps dataset versions to their corresponding file paths for the
                                    train/test/validation splits.

        hash_algorithm (str): Specifies the hashing algorithm to use, either "sha256" or "phash".

        _images_list (list): List of dictionaries containing the image metadata and hashes for all images
                                in the given dataset versions

        _overview_df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing image metadata and hash values.

        overview_with_splits_df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing image metadata, hashvalue and columns indicating which split
                                                    (train/test/validation) the image belongs to.

        duplicates_df (pd.DataFrame):  DataFrame listing duplicate images in the dataset based on hash values.

    Main methods:
        main: Main function to create the overview DataFrame with splits.
        get_raw_df: Get the raw DataFrame containing only the the image metadata and hashes, without any further processing.
        get_overview_df: Get the overview DataFrame grouped by hashvalue, data set version hot encoded and without train/test/val splits
        get_overview_with_splits_df: Get the overview DataFrame with the train/test/val splits included, alternative to main method.
        get_duplicates_df: Get the DataFrame containing the duplicates in the dataset grouped on hash values and data set version.
